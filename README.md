This repository contains the code and applications developed as part of my **Final Degree Project (FDP)** in **Telecommunications Systems Engineering**.

## Project Description

This work is an evolution of the original project [link to the previous project](https://oa.upm.es/69919/1/TFG_IGNACIO_BLASCO_HERNANDEZ.pdf). The following improvements have been made:

- **Automation with artificial intelligence.**
- **Renewal of software and hardware.**
- **Integration of the AvaSpec-2048 spectrometer.**

## System Contents

The system consists of the following applications:

1. **AS7265x Sensor Application**: Software for real-time measurements with a photodiode-based spectrometer.
2. **AvaSpec-2048 Spectrometer Application**: Tool to control the commercial Avantes spectrometer and perform advanced analysis.
3. **Python Program for Fuel Automation using AI**: Uses the KNN algorithm for fuel classification and analysis.
